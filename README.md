# nodejs-practice-file
Its March 2023 and I'm digging into Node JS. So far I'm optimistic that they're a whole lot I can do with the knowledge I am continously acquiring while learning this new technology. Looking to learn NODE JS? You might find my 'jots.txt' file in the repo helpful cos I deposite most of my notes while learning on there. Thank me later : )
